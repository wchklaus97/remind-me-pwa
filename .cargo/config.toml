# Cargo configuration for faster builds

[build]
# Use more jobs for parallel compilation (defaults to number of CPU cores)
# jobs = 4  # Uncomment and set if you want to limit jobs

# Incremental compilation is enabled by default in dev profile
# This speeds up rebuilds by only recompiling changed code

[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
# For WASM builds, we rely on wasm-ld which is already optimized
# No special linker needed for WASM

[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")']
# On macOS, you can use zld for faster linking (optional, requires: cargo install cargo-zld)
# Uncomment the following if you have zld installed:
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=/path/to/zld"]

# Alternative: Use lld if available (faster than default linker)
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"]

# For development builds, reduce optimization to speed up compilation
[profile.dev]
# Already configured in Cargo.toml
